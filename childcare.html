Two babies both girls, Cara and Quinn.  Born 1 May 2021.  


<h1>Feeding</h1>
<ul>
<li>Usually when they wake up we feed them 6oz of formula w/ 1 mL of Poly-Vi-Sol</li>
<li>Feedings afterwards are 5 oz</li>
<li>Usually we feed them X times for 6 + (X-1) * 5 = Y oz over the course of the whole day</li>
<li>We also feed them solids foods in the evenings and sometimes during the day
    <ul>
    <li>For a list of solids they've eaten go to the bottom of this page</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Baby Brezza</li>
    <li>We make all the formula using the baby brezza, it's easy except when it doesn't work :)</li>
    <li>Using the Baby Brezza
        <ul>
        <li>There are two bottons you press</li>
        <li>The first is the "ounce" button, use this to change how much the baby brezza makes</li>
        <li>The second button is the "start" button, this makes the formula.  The process takes a bit longer than you might expect</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>When the baby brezza doesn't work
        <ul>
        <li>There three potential poblems when the baby brezza won't make formula</li>
        <li>The first is that there may not be any formula powder, you can see how much formula is loaded in the hopper easily</li>
        <li>The second problem this that the baby brezza is out of water, you see a water symbol with a line through it when this happens.</li>
        <li>The last problem is that the baby brezza needs to be "cleaned," it needs to be cleaned after you've pressed the start button four times (two feedings for twins)</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
</ul>

<h1>Sleeping</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Cara and Quinn typically wake up at 6:30AM but they can wake up as late as 7:30AM
    <ul>
    <li>They usually sleep through the night without any problems</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We try to nap them 2-3 times a day depending on how long their naps are
    <ul>
        <li>The shortest naps they should take are 30 minutes, please don't let them nap longer than 2 hours</li>
        <li>Don't let them stay awake longer than 3 hours</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
